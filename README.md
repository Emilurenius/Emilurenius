- Current main project:

  I am currently working on some projects here and there on my own. The one I am working the most on is this one: https://github.com/Emilurenius/RGB-controller
  That projects is definately my most ambitious so far.
   I am currently working on the project alone, 
  but I would love any and all help stress testing and developing the software from anyone with a raspberry Pi and WS2812b RGB LEDs lying around.
  The code is currently stable enough for regular use, and is currently connected to my main lights in my bedroom. 
  Development is based on what I feel would be nice for my bedroom lights to do, but I am hoping to get more perspectives on what would be nice to have.
  If you are interested, please reach out to me on emilsen68@gmail.com, and I will get back to you as soon as I can.
